### Project: Ultron

Ultron is a system which helps students keep track of their internship applications by helping them
sort their internships and check the status of each application.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
    * Added `upcoming` feature
      * Drafted the idea of `upcoming` as a feature to remind users of upcoming events.
      * Coded out the entire logic of `upcoming` feature to match the specifications of my group members.
      * Created the parser for the `upcoming` command to be consistent with the implementations of the rest of the commands.
      * After change to keydates, refactored the feature to adapt to the new date formats.

* **Code contributed**:

      * Added Upcoming feature to the User guide with its specifications.
      * Updated the whole User Guide to match the intended functionality of the application.
      * Added screenshots and visuals to the user guide so that users can better visualise the features.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Fixed bugs with side panel not showing when add command is used without any optional fields.
  * Refactored list command to match the specifications of Ultron.
  * Created sample data for Ultron. Refactored existing AB3 methods to display sample data to match specifications for keydates and the removal of tags.
